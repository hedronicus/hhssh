# hhssh

Folx write their publik keys here for server access
Commit your rsa.pub files here with your name on them, and we'll add them to the server

## usage

to become totally rad, one must:

- obtain a public key,
- add it to `./pub_keys.yml`

your pub key generally lives in `~/.ssh`.  you could put it directly into your clipboard using: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy`
